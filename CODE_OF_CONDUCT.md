# Code of Conduct (CoC)

We aim to foster a helpful and empowering environment for all, regardless of level of experience, age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, education, or other similar characteristics. Remember that mistakes are a part of being human; we all make mistakes sometimes. We can work together to address mistakes, learn, and grow by listening to others, self-reflection, and corrective action.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all aspects of our development and works, including, but not limited to:

- Online platforms (social media, chatrooms, mailing lists).
- In-person events (meetings, social gatherings, trips, conferences, camps).
- One-on-one communications.
- Open source projects.
- Internal, external, and public project spaces.
- Other related activities.

The CoC also extends to behavior outside of these spaces if it can affect and may have a negative impact on our and community members' safety or well-being.

## Expected Behavior

- Be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude. Be welcoming.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a correct answer.
- Look out for each other.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a PoC or fork and see how it works.
- Focusing on what is best for the project & community.
- We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, being disrespectful or engaging in behavior that violates the project’s CoC is never okay.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames and profile pictures that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.
- Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist language or actions.
- Disrespectful jokes, innuendo, or dismissive attitudes.
- Intimidation, harassment, or stalking (online or in-person).
- Inappropriate attention or contact (respect others’ boundaries).
- Violence, threats of violence, or unsafe behaviors.
- Spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior.
- Sustained disruptions.
